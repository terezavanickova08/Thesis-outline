# Diary of six years in Siberian captivity
The Diary of Six Years in Siberian Captivity is an authentic confession of Bla≈æej Homola, my great-great-grandfather, who spent six years in Siberia during the First World War and wrote a diary about it. I decided to graphically edit and publish the diary.
